Thanks for visiting my GitHub. I am Dharmil.
I am Computer Engineer, who found his true passion in coding. I love the combination of creative and logical problem-solving skills I get to use when writing code. And I love how there's always more to Learn! 
I am very well organised with all my tasks and things which helps get a clearer, bigger picture under pressure.
I am always eager to learn something new and can quickly grasp new concepts by improving and correcting upon previous mistakes.I am Computer Engineer, who found his true passion in coding.
